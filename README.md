# PwC Call Center Project
During this Power BI job simulation with PwC, I gained hands-on experience, improved my data visualisation and analytical skills with a real-world business case from a top firm.

In this job simulation, I:
- Understood the importance of digital transformation and upskilling in today's business landscape.
- The purpose and goals of the Digital Accelerator program.
- Created a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

# KPIs included in the dashboard:
  - Overall customer satisfaction.
  - Overall calls answered/abandoned.
  - Calls by time.
  - Average speed of answer.
  - Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.
