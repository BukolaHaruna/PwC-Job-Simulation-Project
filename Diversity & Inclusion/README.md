# Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard Summary
The dashboard highlights key insights into hiring, promotions, performance, and turnover across gender lines. The workforce composition shows a gender imbalance, with 59% male employees and 41% female employees. In new hires before FY20 promotions, women were hired at a slightly higher rate (34 vs. 32 males), which doesn't indicate a contribution to the ongoing disparity in promotions.

The promotion analysis reveals that at junior and senior officer levels, promotions are fairly balanced. However, as employees advance to higher roles like Manager, Senior Manager, Director, and Executive, men are promoted at notably higher rates. Taking into account the performance rating analysis, it shows that female employees have hire performance scores (2.49 vs 2.495) when compared to the total number of male and female employees (205 female employees vs 295 male employees) suggesting that performance is not the main factor behind the promotion gap.

The turnover metric indicates that 47 employees left the company, with 26 of them being male employees which doesn't indicate a contribution to the gender gap in senior positions. 

Yet, the promotions overview further confirms that across multiple years, men consistently receive more promotions than women even though the female employees statistically perform better than the male employees.

# Possible Root Causes for Slow Progress in Diversity & Inclusion
* Gender Bias in Promotions:
  - The promotion percentages show fewer women advancing to senior levels (executive and director levels heavily favour men).
  - Women may not have equal access to leadership opportunities.
* Performance Rating Disparity:
  - Both men and women experienced a drop in average performance ratings in FY20.
  - If performance reviews are not linked to promotions, this could limit the career progression of certain groups.
* High Turnover or Career Stagnation for Women:
  - The number of male leavers (26) were more and male employees still have a hire chance of being promoted. This doesn't promote better performance once the female employees realise their performances were not taken into account.
