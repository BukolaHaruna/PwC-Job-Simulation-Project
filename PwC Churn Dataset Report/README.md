The management wanted to know more about their customers. They requested a clearly visualised dashboard that's self-explanatory for the management.

# My Task
* Defined proper KPIs.
* Created a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs.
* Wrote a short email to the engagement partner explaining my findings, and included suggestions as to what needs to be changed.


# Key findings & Recommendations to Improve Customer Retention and Overall Business Performance.

Key Findings:

High Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have left, with churn being more common among newer customers (0–6 months tenure group).
Service Type Impact: A good number of services like internet services and device protection have high churn rate, suggesting dissatisfaction with service quality or pricing.
Customer Demographics: Customers without dependents appear to churn more frequently, possibly indicating that family oriented customers find more value in the services.
Contract Type Influence: Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those on long term contracts.

Recommendations:

Improve Customer Onboarding & Engagement: I suggest strengthening the first 6-month engagement with personalised offers, proactive customer support, and onboarding incentives to reduce early churn.
Enhance Service Quality & Value Proposition: Investigate issues related to services, potentially improving speed, reliability, and pricing. Also, consider offering loyalty discounts or service bundles to retain customers considering alternatives.
Introduce Customer Loyalty Programs: Consider incentive programs (discounts, perks, or exclusive content) for long-term contracts. Also, offer referral programs to encourage word of mouth advertisement.
Tailor Marketing Strategies to Demographics: Target customers without dependents with customised service plans or added perks.
Strengthen Customer Support & Feedback Channels: Implement real time customer feedback mechanisms to address issues before they lead to churn. Consider using predictive analytics to identify at risk customers and proactively offer retention solutions.

By implementing these strategies, we can reduce churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
