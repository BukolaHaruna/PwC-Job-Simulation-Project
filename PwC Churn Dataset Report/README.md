The management wanted to know more about their customers. They requested a clearly visualised dashboard that's self-explanatory for the management.

# My Task
* Defined proper KPIs.
* Created a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs.
* Wrote a short email to the engagement partner explaining my findings, and included suggestions as to what needs to be changed.
